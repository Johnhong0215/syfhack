 Alright everyone, let's get it going. We'll have a quick five-minute meeting.  First quick update on the fraud detection model. We've seen recall fall from  0.87 to 0.79, especially among new car holders under 30. Yeah, so I pulled  example yesterday false positives are definitely creeping up. I'll do a  deeper dive, could be drift or maybe profile shift post campaign. Thanks  John, can you have the analysts ready by Tuesday about June 3rd? Yeah, of course.  I'll check the future of pipeline to that April and Justin pipeline update  might be introducing noise. I'll validate distributions by segment. Good  cash. Alright switching gears to Sarah. Quick heads up, new CFPV  explainability rules hit July 1st. We need full shaft support on the  credit limit model and documentation must be audit ready. The shaft  dashboard is 90% done. I'll finalize the rest and walk out through it next  Thursday. Awesome, I'll remove model docs and flag anything that needs  polished by the seventh. Should we involve legal before the end of June? Just  in case they want to say in how we explain decisions? Definitely. I'll add  it to the pre-audit checklist and set up a short sync with them. Great, next up  David for retraining. The income estimation model retraining is over  two light two weeks. Let's kick that off today. I'll launch the pipeline after  this call should finish by tomorrow evening. Once it's done, I'll compare pre and  post accuracy and send results by Wednesday. Perfect. Final item is the  new business request for Priya. Product wants to simplify three tier risk  model for instant approvals, low, medium, and high. I can define preliminary  cutoffs using historical approval rates. That way we're aligned with risk  appetite. I'll scope out what changes we need on the scoring backend and  proposing new structure by June 6th. And I'll work with Michael to validate  theory logic and define what success looks like. Alright, that was a great  teamwork session. Let's reconvene June 5th at 10 p.m. Thanks everyone.
